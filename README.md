# 🧮 Maxima-Minima Calculator (2 Variables)

This is a GUI-based calculator that determines **stationary points** (maxima, minima, or saddle points) of functions with **two variables** using partial derivatives. It combines the power of **Python** and **C** to deliver accurate symbolic computation in a user-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Calculates stationary points of 2-variable functions using partial differentiation  
- 🔍 Classifies points as maxima, minima, or saddle  
- 🔁 Hybrid backend using **C** for performance and **Python** for GUI and integration  
- 🖥️ Simple GUI interface with input box for custom equations  
- ✅ Works offline (just download and run the `.exe`)
